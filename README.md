# Mini Search Engine Frontend

## Introduction

This is the frontend project of Mini Search Engine. We have deployed our website on https://kok-kip.github.io/frontend//#/, we **strongly recommend** you to access this website instead of running this project directly because codes in this repository may not be stable.

## How to run

1. install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. run the project in dev environment

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**Note:** We are sorry to tell you that we have not yet deployed our server. If you want to experience the whole search function, we sincerely ask you to download our backend project and run locally. We promise we may deploy our service as soon as we have enough resource. Thank you!
