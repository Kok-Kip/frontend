# Mini Search Engine Frontend

## Introduction

This is the frontend project of Mini Search Engine. We have deployed our website on https://kok-kip.github.io/frontend//#/, we **strongly recommend** you to access this website instead of running this project directly because codes in this repository may not be stable.

## How to run

1. install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. run the project in dev environment

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**News:** Good News! We have successfully deployed out search service on a remote machine on 24, Jan. Now you can access the website above to use our search engine. Thank you!

Pay attention that we only have one machine so we can not promise a strongly reliable service. If you come across any problem when using our service, please contact our developers.
